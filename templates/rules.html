<div class="ribbonBanner">Prior to the Event</div>
<div class="infoSection">
Ideas may be brainstormed before the start time, but no implementation work may be done ahead of time. This includes coding and graphic design. Teams may, however, practice using any APIs or data sources necessary so long as none of the code involved is used in the submitted project.
</div>

<div class="ribbonBanner">The Event Itself</div>
<div class="infoSection">
Participants are free to seek help from any available resources during the hackathon, including online tutorials, on-site support staff, mentors, and members of other teams, so long as the work to be submitted is done entirely by members of that team.

Teams can schedule their own work time during the 48-hour competition period. All work, including presentation preparation, must stop at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday, January 25, when teams will submit their entries to the judges.

<div class="ribbonBanner">After the Event</div>
<div class="infoSection">
By submitting a project, you and your team grant the Tri-Co Hackathon organizers the unrestricted right to use your submission material, at no cost, for promotional purposes of future Tri-Co Hackathon events.
</div>


<div class="ribbonBanner">Judging Criteria</div>
<div class="infoSection">
Submissions will be evaluated based on multiple criteria ranging from technical sophistication to social impact. For each teamâ€™s submission, each judge will give a 1 to 5 score in each criterion. After all projects have been presented, the judges will convene and choose an overall winner and various category winners. The winning teams will not necessarily be the ones with the highest scores but rather will be determined by the judges.
