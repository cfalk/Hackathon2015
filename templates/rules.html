Ideas may be brainstormed before the start time, but <span class="popWord">no implementation</span> work may be done ahead of time. This includes coding and graphic design. Teams may, however, practice using any APIs, frameworks, or data sources necessary so long as none of the code involved is used in the submitted project.
